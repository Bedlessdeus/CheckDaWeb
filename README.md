## 🚀 Getting Started

CheckDaWeb is designed to be easy to set up and use. The primary recommended method for deployment is via Docker.

### Installation via Docker

Detailed instructions for pulling and running the Docker image, including configuration for environment variables, can be found on the dedicated [Docker Page](https://hub.docker.com/r/bedlessdeus/checkdaweb).

You can find the Docker image on Docker Hub: bedlessdeus/checkdaweb.
Images are tagged as `bedlessdeus/checkdaweb:latest` and `bedlessdeus/checkdaweb:${version}` (e.g., v0.0.1).

Once the Docker image is running, you can access the CheckDaWeb web interface through your browser.

## 🌐 Usage

CheckDaWeb provides a user-friendly web interface where you can input a website URL and view the comprehensive analysis results.

You can also access a public instance of CheckDaWeb for immediate use:

  * **Public Instance (Development/Testing):** https://checkdaweb.shardq001.bedless.dev

**Important Note for Public Instances:**
When using the public instances, please be aware that your usage is subject to the **Terms of Service (TOS)** and **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance**. We encourage you to review these documents for details on data handling and user responsibilities.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables
CheckDaWeb uses several environment variables for configuration, especially important for self-hosted instances. These variables should be set when running the Docker container:

* `PRIVATE_FAVICON_FONT`: **REQUIRED**. Path to the TrueType Font (`.ttf`) file used by the favicon generator within the container. For example: `/checkdaweb/data/favicon_gen.ttf`. **You must ensure this font file is mounted into the container at the specified path.**

* `PRIVATE_FAVICON_CACHE_TIME`: **REQUIRED**. Cache time in seconds for favicon generation (e.g., `86400` for 1 day).

* `PRIVATE_FAVICON_COLOR_OFFSET`: **REQUIRED**. Color offset value (integer) for the favicon generation.

* `PRIVATE_SELF_URL`: **REQUIRED**. The base URL of your CheckDaWeb instance, used for Content Security Policy (CSP) and other internal references (e.g., `http://your-domain.com` or `http://localhost:3000`).

Refer to the [Docker Page](https://hub.docker.com/r/bedlessdeus/checkdaweb) for examples on how to set these variables when running your container.
